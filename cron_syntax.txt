 expression “cron(0 22 * * ? *)”. Since the times are in UTC I put the hour at 22 (10pm at night) which is 18EST (6pm Eastern Standard Time). 
Remember that I wanted the EC2 to shut off automatically at 6pm as our developers usually leave around 5:30 each day.
Half an hour gave enough time for employees to shut down their computer
 
 cron(0 22 * * ? *) shuts the EC2 instance down at 6pm EST every day.
